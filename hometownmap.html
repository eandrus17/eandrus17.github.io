Even though I only lived there for a few months before moving to Utah for school, it is still home when I go back. The house is on 40 acres of land, and our friend owns the neighboring 40. It makes for some good hiking and fourwheeling.</h2>';

Lots of volleyball, theater, singing, and I guess some studying. Fun story, my junior year, one our teachers disappeared. He just stopped coming to school. We still dont know where he went</h2>';
