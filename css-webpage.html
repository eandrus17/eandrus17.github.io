  <h2> A Brief History </font></h2>
  <!--a brief history-->
  <p> The Dominican Republic was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and claimed the island for the Spanish Crown. Independence was won from Spain in 1821, and after some turmoil with the French and Haiti, the first Dominican constitution was established in 1844. The politics since then have been volatile, with new constitutions created, dictatorships, short-lived governments, etc. However, even in the midst of turmoil, the Dominican Republic has the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central America and one of the fastest growing gross domestic products in the Americas.
    
  <h2> Music </h2>
   <p> The two official dances of the Dominican Republic are Merengue and Bachata. Both originated in the DR and are a large part of Dominican identity.
     
  <h3> Merengue </h3>
   <p> Merengue was considered a low-class style of music until Dictator Rafael Trujillo promoted it during his leadership in the 1960s. It was originally played on string instruments but now includes the accordion. Merengue is recognized by its steady beat and the accordion.
It is danced with a simple 1-2 step pattern, where the dancer essentially shifts weight from side to side on the beat. </p>

  <h3> Bachata </h3>
  <p> Dominican Bachata was originally slower paced and solemn but as it became more popular the tempos increased and the instruments changed. Like Merengue, Bachata was originally deemed “low class” and was banned from television and radio, but has become more wdiely accepted and popular. It is typically played with guitars, bongos, and the güira. Bachata has a 4-count rhythm, with the bongos keeping time. The dance is done by stepping on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd beat, and then "tapping" the toe and moving the hip up on the 4th beat. </P>
